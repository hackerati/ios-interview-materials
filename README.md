# iOS-Interview-Materials
Materials for the iOS live coding session

1. ObjC Interview
  There are several problems with this poorly written code.  Have the candidate find as many problems as they can and fix them.

2. Swift Interview
  Same as #1, in Swift.

3. Word Search (algorithms, ObjC)
  Use only for more advanced candidates. The candidates must find all the solutions when a user clicks a tile on the board.  The only code changes they may make are in the Solver files.
